# Portfolio project
For this week project, I made a personal portfolio page from scratch using html and css.
I utilized tools such as media screen to change the background color of the screen according to the width
I also utilized some new typography tools to help me make the fonts look better
# Steps
1. Create a portoflio with image, links, and writing
2. Clicking on the links would lead you to another page
3. Resizing the screen would lead to the contents getting smaller
4. The website was given a descriptive title
# Additional steps
1. Readme page
2. both html and css are properly commented

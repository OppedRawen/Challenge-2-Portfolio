        <h1>About me</h1>
        
        <p1>Hi my name is David Yu, nice to me meet you. I'm currently a student at Irvine Valley College and UCI bootcamp. My major is computer science, and my goal is that within this year I 
            can land myself a web development job through this program. 
            I used to work at a Japanese curry restraunt as a line cook and it was a lot of fun, but unfortunately I had to quite because of the work load. 
            My favorite hobbies are video games, skateboarding, and cooking. I have always enjoyed playing video games(one of the reasons that got me into programming), and skateboarding was
            something that my friends got me into back in middle school and I have loved it ever since. Recently, since moving out, I have gotten interested in culinary as well.
            I'm mainly proficient in cooking cantonese foods since I grew up eating them, but I have been trying to learn Italian cuisine and baking as well recently.</p1>

        <h1>Background</h1>
        <p1>I'm born and raised in Guangzhou China and immigrated to the US when I was 12. 
            Though I have not been back there for over 4 years now, still I have a lot of fond memories of the place. Some things that I missed the most about China has to be
             the foods and my friends. Often times, when my friends from China comes to visit me, I have them bring a variety of Chinese snacks that I can't find here in America. 
            This photo was taken when I was 4 years old in Yunnan China and I don't remember much about it. But it is one of the few photos I have taken together with my grandfather 
            who unfortunately passed away when I was young. He was an incredible kind and influential figure for me, and someone that I look up to the most. </p1>

        <h1>Education</h1>
        <p1>I graduated from University High School in 2021. High school was a fun experience for me and I met a lot of incredible friends during those 4 years.
            But one thing that I regret the most is not trying hard enough at school. I feel like I wasted a lot of my potential during my high school years
            because I never really knew what I wanted to do in the future. But now that I'm determined to be a software engineer,
            I hope I can live up to my standard more. Above is a photo of me and my friends. You can see how awkard I'm here.</p1>
